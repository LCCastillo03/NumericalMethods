# Numerical Methods Repository

This repository contains implementations of numerical methods focused on Python. The included methods are useful for solving mathematical problems using computational techniques.


## Repository Contents

This repository currently includes implementations of the following methods:
- **Conversions**: Binary to Decimal, IEEE 754.
- **Finding roots**: Includes methods such as Bisection, Fixed Point, Newton Raphson, Regula Falsi, Secant.
- **Polynomial Interpolation**: Includes methods such as Lagrange interpolation and Newton interpolation.
- **Numerical Integration Methods**: Such as the trapezoidal rule and Simpson's rule.
- **Differential Equation Solvers**: Such as Runge-Kutta methods.

More methods will be added over time as new implementations are developed.
