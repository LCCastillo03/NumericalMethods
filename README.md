# Numerical Methods Repository

This repository contains implementations of numerical methods focused on Python. The included methods are useful for solving mathematical problems using computational techniques.

## Contents

Currently, this repository includes implementations of the following methods:

- **Bisection Method**: A method for finding roots of nonlinear equations.
- **Newton-Raphson Method**: Used to find roots of functions through successive approximations.
- **Polynomial Interpolation**: Includes methods such as Lagrange interpolation and Newton interpolation.
- **Numerical Integration Methods**: Such as the trapezoidal rule and Simpson's rule.
- **Differential Equation Solvers**: Such as Euler's method and Runge-Kutta methods.

More methods will be added over time as new implementations are developed.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

1. **Roots**:
   - `/BisectionMethod`
   - `/NewtonRaphson`
   - `/SecantMethod`
   - `/FixedPoint`
   - `/RegulaFalsi`

2. **Conversions**:
   - `/BinaryToDecimal`
   - `/IEEE754`

3. **Series**:
   - `/TaylorSeries`

## Usage

Each folder within the repository contains a specific README explaining how to use the corresponding implementation. Make sure to have the appropriate execution environment set up for each method.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to add a new numerical method or improve an existing implementation, feel free to submit a pull request. Be sure to follow the contribution guidelines outlined in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
