# Numerical Methods Repository

This repository contains implementations of numerical methods focused on Python. The included methods are useful for solving mathematical problems using computational techniques.


## Repository Contents

This repository currently includes implementations of the following methods:

- **Bisection Method**: A method for finding roots of nonlinear equations.
- **Newton-Raphson Method**: Used to find roots of functions through successive approximations.
- **Polynomial Interpolation**: Includes methods such as Lagrange interpolation and Newton interpolation.
- **Numerical Integration Methods**: Such as the trapezoidal rule and Simpson's rule.
- **Differential Equation Solvers**: Such as Euler's method and Runge-Kutta methods.

More methods will be added over time as new implementations are developed.


## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

1. **Roots**:
   - `/BisectionMethod.py`
   - `/FixedPoint.py`
   - `/NewtonRaphson.py`
   - `/RegulaFalsi.py`
   - `/SecantMethod.py`

2. **Conversions**:
   - `/ConversionBinary.py`
   - `/ConversionIEEE754.py`

3. **System Equations**:
   - `/Crout.py`
